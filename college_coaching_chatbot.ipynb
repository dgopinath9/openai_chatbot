    "# College Coaching Chatbot\n",
    "\n",
    "This script uses the OpenAI API to create a chatbot that acts as a college counselor who helps students find colleges that fit their background and interests. The chatbot asks a series of questions to the student about academics, career, extra-curriculars, and college preferences, and then generates a list of five colleges or universities that would be a good fit for the student, along with the reasoning behind each suggestion. It then generates a JSON array summarizing key details about the student and the college recommendations it makes.   "
