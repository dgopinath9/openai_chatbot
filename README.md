# College Coaching Chatbot

This is a simple project to play with the OpenAI API and gpt-3.5-turbo to practice prompt engineering following the ChatGPT Prompt Engineering for Developers course I took from DeepLearning.ai. 

The code creates a chatbot that acts as a college counselor who suggests colleges or universities based on a student's interests and preferences. 

Requires an OpenAI API key to run.
